# Cleaning Vs Tidying

My girlfriend and I have a difference of opinion when it comes to cleaning up.

I like to clean and wash-up before the food is even on the table.
I'll make sure that before we've sat down to eat, everything in the kitchen is back to normal.

And the same goes for cleaning.
I'll make small efforts at regular intervals to leave things as I found them,
essentially resetting the debt before I leave the area.

My rational is that it's less daunting to confront small issues regularly,
long before they become overwhelming, than to wait until they grow to a size that can no longer be ignored.
At which point I find the looming task so confronting that I'll procrastinate further and the issue snowballs.

On the flip side, she likes to leave all the pots in the sink and commit to the task once a day.
Or one big house clean every week.

Her take is that overall, it's less work and a more efficient use of time,
it avoids regular context switching, which can be exhausting,
and once you're in the right mindset, you're able to commit and do a better job overall.

Are there rights and wrongs here?

A common fallacy is to assume your way is the right way because it speaks to your rational.

You might agree with either one of us,
but that would likely be a subjective opinion biased towards your own unique thought mechanisms.

It's very hard to be objective without being empathetic,
and only by stepping out of my own perspective and into hers
am I able to appreciate why her approach is equally valid to her as mine is to me.

We're now both able to see that each of our approaches has equal merit;
they're simply tools that can be applied to solve the underlying problem in different ways,
each addressing the different strengths, needs, weaknesses and requirements of the individual.

Moving forward together with this mindset,
we're able
to use the best of both approaches
to promote a living environment that's better than either single approach alone.
