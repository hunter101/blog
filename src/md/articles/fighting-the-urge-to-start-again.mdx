# Fighting the urge to start again

For any sufficiently large project, there comes a tipping point when an overbearing sense of lack of control starts to snowball. Quickly following by the thought: "I bet if I started again and did X differently, everything would be as it should next time".

Whether it's the latest framework that's caught your eye (side-eyes javascript), less hacky solutions to sticky problems, architectural and designs decisions that you've come to regret. This fallacy will plague your mind for the remainder of the project.

It's the age-old adage 'the grass is always greener on the other side' and it's likely the cause for 95% of projects that never reach fruition.

Giving in to the impulse, is failing to appreciate we're re-enforcing our own groundhog day. Starting over reduces our resolve to push through when things get tough. On the next iteration, when the same creeping thoughts start to take hold, the decision to start afresh becomes the easy choice.

The ability to combat this impulse ultimately comes down to discipline. Squaring up to issues and fixing mistakes takes work. It's hard, not fun like it was at the start. Gone are the green, rolling vistas. Unburdened by debt, our brains once awash with endorphins, unhinged with visions of greatness. Replaced with a never-ending sense of dread that washes over us when confronting the reality of software development.

It's easy to ideologically regurgitate dogma to avoid this fate. If we were capable of robotically following programming ideals to the letter. We'd never be staring, red-eyed, at this plate of spaghetti once called a codebase.

What can be done?

Break down problems into small, manageable chunks that can be resolved in a single sitting. The sense of accomplishment from small wins creates regular hits of dopamine to fuel further progress. Consistently putting one foot in front of the other without staring into the distance, will get you to your destination faster than sitting and pondering the vastness of the void.

Perfection is the enemy of progress. Is what you already have good enough to get you to your next milestone? Not the vision that you had when starting the work, but the very next tangible objective that needs to be met to keep the project moving forward. If so, then make a note and keep going. Address the issue when it becomes an issue.

Have the foresight to appreciate that when you do bail and start again, there will come a time when you find yourself back in the exact same place. If you always run from your problems, on the way to every destination, you're going to keep running into the same wall. Each time, you'll be older and with nothing to show for it.

Ultimately the work involved in taking a project from start to finish isn't glamorous. Early stage ideas and visions unlock feelings of accomplishment without actually accomplishing anything.

When I look back, it would be nice to see the fruits of my labour making a positive change in the world, not a scrapbook full of half finished prototypes gathering dust in the dark.

After all, that's why we started this project in the first place isn't it?
