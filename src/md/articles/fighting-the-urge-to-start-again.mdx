# Fighting the urge to start again

For any sufficiently large software project, there comes a tipping point when the overbearing sense of chaos starts to snowball. Quickly following by the thought: "I bet if I started again and did X differently, everything would be perfect".

Whether it's the latest framework that's caught your eye (side-eyes javascript), less hacky solutions to sticky problems, architectural and designs decisions that you've come to regret. This fallacy will plague your mind for the remainder of the project.

It's the age-old adage 'the grass is always greener on the other side' and it's likely the cause for 95% of projects that never reach fruition.

Giving in to the impulse, is failing to appreciate we're re-enforcing our own groundhog day.

Starting over reduces our resolve to push through when things get tough. On the next iteration, when the same creeping thoughts start to take hold, the decision to start afresh becomes the easy choice.

The ability to combat this impulse ultimately comes down to discipline. Squaring up to issues and fixing mistakes takes work. It's hard, not fun like it was at the start. Gone are the green, rolling vistas... Unburdened by debt, our brains once awash with endorphins, unhinged with visions of greatness. Replaced with a looming sense of dread when confronting the giant mess that once showed so much promise.

It's easy to ideologically regurgitate dogma that would avoid this fate. However, if we were capable of robotically following programming ideals to the byte. We'd never find ourselves staring, red-eyed, into the plate of spaghetti that once resembled a codebase.

So, now we're here, what can we do?

#### Set small goals

Break down problems into small, manageable chunks, resolvable in a single sitting. The sense of accomplishment from small wins creates regular hits of dopamine to fuel further progress. Consistently putting one foot in front of the other without staring into the distance, will get you to your destination faster than sitting and pondering the vastness of the void.

#### Perfection is the enemy of progress

Is what you already have good enough to carry you to your next milestone? Forget about the grand vision that motivated you when first starting out, but focus on the very next tangible objective that needs to be met to keep the project moving forward. If so, refactoring right now will ultimately not benefit progress. Address the issue when it becomes an issue.

#### Walk in the shoes of your future self

Have the foresight to appreciate that when you do throw in the towel and start again, there will come a time in the next project when you're back at the same crossroads. If everytime you hit the wall you always run in the opposite direction. On every journey, you're going to keep running into the same wall. And with each reset, all that you will have accumulated is time.

Ultimately the work involved in taking a project from conception to completion isn't glamorous. Brainstorming and dreaming unlock feelings of accomplishment without actually accomplishing anything. The real path to success lies in the trenches, confronting problems and making the hard decisions day after day until you finally break through. And if you stick at anything long enough, you'll always succeed.

When I look back, it would be nice to see the projects I've put time into out there in the big wide world, making an impact in the lives of others, not lining the forgotten pages of a scrapbook, full of abandoned prototypes gathering dust in the dark.

After all, isn't that's why you started this project in the first place?
